> **"Master-Slave Inversion"**: The backend is the master, driving the mission loop. The React frontend is the tactical cockpit, monitoring the slaughter in real-time.

## 🏹 High-Fidelity Industrial Suites

### 1. 🛰️ VPH Sentiment Radar
An autonomous interceptor that scans the YouTube spectrum for "Viral Mutations" (breakout videos). When a host is detected with high **VPH (Velocity Per Hour)**, it's targeted for parasitic hijacking.

### 2. 🧬 DFL Pipeline Matrix
The core industrial pipeline. 6 stages of pure conversion:
- **Pending** -> **Scraping** (Host Gene Extraction) -> **Mutating** (Gemini Reinforcement) -> **Muxing** (Vocal/Visual Synthesis) -> **Uploading** -> **Completed** (Final Deployment).

### 3. 🛡️ EvoMap Immune Terminal (GEP-A2A)
A neural-defense layer. When YouTube updates its DOM and breaks the uploader, EvoMap automatically fetches security capsules to hot-patch selectors in memory. No downtime. No manual fixes.

### 4. 📊 CTR Matrix
Real-time A/B performance monitoring. Gemini generates 5 variant "Personality Capes" (titles/thumbnails). The system automatically rotates them and tracks performance down to the second.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack: The Iron Foundry

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Tailwind CSS (Cyberpunk Tactical UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (Industrial Mission Loop)
- **Intelligence**: Gemini 1.5 Pro (Multimodal Mutation)
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs (Vocal Reconstruction)
- **Security**: EvoMap GEP-A2A Self-Healing Protocol
- **Persistence**: SQLite (State Machine Consistency)

## 🚀 Ignition Commands

### 🧪 Military Drill (E2E Test)
Verify the full industrial loop without burning API credits:
```bash
# Start backend in test mode
$env:NODE_ENV='test'; node server/index.js

# Trigger Playwright Agent
npx playwright test tests/e2e-pipeline.spec.js --headed
```

### 🔥 Industrial Production
```bash
# Start the Industrial Engine
npm run dev
cd server && node index.js
```

## 📜 Constitution of the Undead
*"This system exists to intercept, mutate, and dominate the digital attention economy. Every mission is tracked. Every failure is healed. The factory never stops."*
